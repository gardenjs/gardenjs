# Component library explorer

Gardenjs is a lightweight UI component explorer for JavaScript front-end libraries that makes it easier to develop, test and document UI components and pages. Svelte, Vue and React are currently supported out of the box. Other libraries can also be easily connected to Garden.

## Why Garden?

- Gardenjs is significantly faster than comparable tools such as Storybook.
- Gardenjs is multi-framework compatible.
- Gardenjs has many useful features without being complex and bloated.
- Gardenjs simply looks good :)
