# Gardenjs

+++ TEST RELEASE, COMING SOON +++

Gardenjs is a lightweight and lightning-fast UI component explorer for JavaScript front-end libraries that makes it easier to develop, test and document UI components and pages. Other libraries can also be easily connected to Garden.

## Why Gardenjs?

- Significantly faster than comparable tools such as Storybook.
- Multi-framework compatible.
- Many useful features without being complex and bloated.
- Simply looks good :)

## Getting Started

Please follow the documentation at [gardenjs.org](https://www.gardenjs.org).

Happy Gardening :)

## Supported Frameworks

The support of JS frameworks is realized by renderer plugins. There are currently renderers for...

- [Svelte](https://github.com/gardenjs/render-plugin-svelte)
- [Vue](https://github.com/gardenjs/render-plugin-vue)
- [React](https://github.com/gardenjs/render-plugin-react)

These can be selected during the installation of Gardenjs or later. You can easily create plugins for other frameworks. Contact us, we will be happy to link your plugins here.

## Contributing

Gardenjs was developed and is contributed by [Rabbit Development](https://www.rabbitdevelopment.de). We look forward to your feedback, please report any bugs. We also welcome contributions and are happy about sponsoring.
