# Component library explorer

Garden is a lightweight UI explorer for JavaScript frontend libraries that helps you build, test and display UI components and pages. Svelte[, Vue and React] are currently supported out of the box. Other libraries can also be easily connected to Garden.
<br><br>

## This is Garden

Garden is the showroom for what you grow. The explorer represents each component of your design system in isolation. The different states of the components are also shown. Garden is developed for JavaScript frontend projects of any size. Code changes are reflected at the speed of light by the build tool Vite. Garden is an MIT-licensed open source project.
<br><br>

## Getting Started (Examples for Svelte)

Install Garden inside your project root with NPM: [not yet, now: instead: checkout garden in garden base folder: 'npm link' or 'sudo npm link']

```console
npm install --save-dev garden
```

[not yet ...]
Follow the installation routine.

In the root directory you will now find your Garden configuration file 'garden.config.js' to adapt Garden to your project.
[... not yet!]

Svelte example configuration for your garden.config.json file:

```json
{
  "garden": {
    "serverport": 3010,
    "wssocketport": 3011,
    "destination": "garden/",
    "structure": {
      "custom": {
        "components": "/src/components/"
      }
    },
    "watch": {
      "directories": [
        "./src"
      ],
      "include": [
        ".svelte", ".das.json", ".scss", ".css", ".js"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Add those directories to "structure" > "custom" that are to be displayed on the first level of the Garden Navigation.

### Initialize Garden

Initialize Garden in the root of the project directory:

```bash
run initGarden
```

### Run Garden

Run `serveGarden` from the root of the project. Or add it to your `package.json` there and run it via `npm run garden` :

```json
  "scripts": {
    "garden": "serveGarden",
  },
```

### Configure Garden with project-specific settings
With the garden.config.js you have various options to customize Garden to suit your project. Take a look at the file for a quick overview of the options already implemented. Here you can also make your own individual adjustments with JavaScript, e.g. to switch between your different themes.

### Open Garden

Open Garden in the browser via `http://localhost:<serverport>/garden`. The server port is defined in `garden.config.js`, the default setting is 3010.

## Output of components (and pages) and add variants or states

In order to be able to output variants or states of components, you must create two additional files in the component directory:

With a `<component>.example.svelte` file you create all variants/states of the component. It then looks like this, for example:

```js
<script>
  import Button from './<component>.svelte'

  export let story
</script>

{#if story == 'story_1'}
<!-- code example -->

{:else if story == 'story_2'}
<!-- code example -->

{:else if story == 'story_3'}
<!-- code example -->

{/if}
```

Create a file `<component>.das.js` so that the variants/states are output in the panel and the navigation below the stage. In addition, a description or information about the component can be added here. It then looks like this, for example:

```js
export default {
  name: "<component>",
  file: "./<component>.example.svelte",
  description: "<A description/info of the component can be added here...>",
  examples: [
    {story: "<navigation title for story_1>", input: {story: "story_1"}},
    {story: "<navigation title for story_2>", input: {story: "story_2"}},
    {story: "<navigation title for story_3>", input: {story: "story_3"}},
  ]
}
```

* [feature] Add search to sidebar nav.
* [feature] Add .md or .mdx to description in panel for text info. v1 or v1.1?
* [refactor] Move logic to own file. handle user interaction. check the error messages on the svelte files in the vs code (e.g. stage.svelte, gardenapp.svelte ...).
* [task] Make Garden compatible with Vue & React.
* [task] Build mini demo for new projects with own github repository (like carrots but just as "hello world).
* [task] install script / commandline skeleton project (example component.)
* [task] Set repository public & make garden npm modul. (yarn?)

### v1.1

* [feature] Collapse/expand panel button in sidebar and close btn in panel nav.
* [feature] Set default mode in garden.config.json.
* [feature] Screenshot-tests
* [task] Integrate Svelte A11y features.
* [bug] Prevent horizontal drag bar from slipping out of view when moving down.
* [task] Improve Garden for smaller displays:
  * Sidebarnav is closed by default on narrow display devices.
  * ...
* [feature] Vertical dragbar to drag stage horizontical to show rwd behaviour. Already integrated staticly, just needs to be commented out in topbar.svelte: Show 'px' width/height of stage next to rwd-navi.
* [task] Build kickstarter "carrots". Define components for carrots.
