## The quick and easy alternative

Gardenjs is an open source UI component library explorer for JS frameworks and provides a centralized platform for developers to create, test and present UI components and pages in isolation. Gardenjs promotes modular and reusable code, streamlines collaboration between team members and increases overall productivity. Gardenjs is designed for projects of any size.

Watch the <a href="https://www.gardenjs.org/demo/">demo</a> (coming very soon).

## Why Gardenjs?

- Significantly faster than comparable tools such as Storybook.
- Simple and efficient working.
- Many useful features without being complex and bloated.
- Integration of external libraries within a project.
- Multiple frameworks running in a single instance.
- More flexible and extensive work with decorators and hooks.
- Simply looks good :)

## Getting Started

Please follow the documentation at <a href="https://www.gardenjs.org/docs" target="_blank">gardenjs.org</a> (coming very soon). Happy Gardening!

## Supported Frameworks

HTML snippets are rendered by default. The support of JS frameworks is realized by renderer plugins. There are currently plugins for <a href="https://github.com/gardenjs/render-plugin-svelte" target="_blank">Svelte</a>, <a href="https://github.com/gardenjs/render-plugin-vue" target="_blank">Vue</a> and <a href="https://github.com/gardenjs/render-plugin-react" target="_blank">React</a>. You can also easily create plugins for other frameworks, see the documentation. Contact us, we will be happy to create a repository for your renderer plugin.
