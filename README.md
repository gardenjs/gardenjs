Test Release, coming soon ...

# Component library explorer

Gardenjs is a lightweight UI component explorer for JavaScript front-end libraries that makes it easier to develop, test and document UI components and pages. Svelte, Vue and React are currently supported out of the box. Other libraries can also be easily connected to Garden.

## Why Gardenjs?

- Significantly faster than comparable tools such as Storybook.
- Multi-framework compatible.
- Many useful features without being complex and bloated.
- Simply looks good :)

## Getting Started

Please follow the documentation at [gardenjs.org](https://www.gardenjs.org).

Happy Gardening :)
