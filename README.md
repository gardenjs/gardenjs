# Component library explorer

Garden is a lightweight UI component explorer for JavaScript front-end libraries that makes it easier to develop, test and document UI components and pages. Svelte, Vue and React are currently supported out of the box. Other libraries can also be easily connected to Garden.

## Why Garden?

- Garden is significantly faster than comparable tools such as Storybook.
- Garden is multi-framework compatible.
- Garden has many useful features without being complex and bloated.
- Garden simply looks good :)
